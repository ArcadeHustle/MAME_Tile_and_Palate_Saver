Hi,

maybe this could be valuable for some people around here too, i modified MAME v0.128 to allow tiles and sprites saving + a couple of other options.

[url=http://pagesperso-orange.fr/franck.charlet/mamed_ts.zip]http://pagesperso-orange.fr/franck.charlet/mamed_ts.zip[/url]

here is an example with capcom's side arms game (as they're directly saved from mame but converted to .png):

and the content of the readme file:

This is an enhanced version of MAME (the Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator) v0.128
with the possiblity to save tiles and palettes.

---------------

Note:

Gfx are saved as .bmp format (files are optimized during saving but can become pretty big anyway, so beware),
the layout (number of tiles/row) follows the one chosen by the user.

Notice that the files can be saved several times during a session without the older ones being overwritten
(new ones will be created with different numbers), i implemented it that way because sometimes
it's necessary to save the set of tiles again due to changes in the palette (mostly between game levels).

What's left is to spot in games which tiles or sprites are used with what palette and to keep the right ones,
it's not perfect but it makes ripping gfx from arcade games it a lot easier than before.

Notice that some games don't use tiles (or no paletted ones).

---------------

Here are the extra gui commands:

In palette view:

'S' key will create a directory (if necessary) with the loaded game name & save the current palette into it as a .pal file.

In tiles view:

'S' key will create a directory (if necessary) with the loaded game name & save all the tiles with all the possible palettes within a single big (sometimes huge) file.

'LEFT SHIFT'+'S' key will create a directory (if necessary) with the loaded game name & save all the tiles with all the possible palettes scattered in as many files as there are possible palettes.

'G' key will switch the gap between tiles on/off (also reflected in saved files layout).

---------------

I also added a 'windowzoom' option in mame.ini to allow to magnify the window when it's not maximized or in full screen mode, this can be used to obtain a bigger window without being distorted to do pixel perfect zoomed screenshots.
